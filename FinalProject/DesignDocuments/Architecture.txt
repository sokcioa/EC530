The purpose of this Project is to enable and simplify errands with a special focus on accessibility

The Meat will be user input and Calendar syncing
    1: (OPTIONAL) user signs into google account and syncs calendar
        Calendar entries need locations or the user will be prompted 
            to add locations 
                ignore <this> entry without location EX: John's Birthday Reminder
            ignore entries without locations 
            to define access type
    2: User adds home address
        This will be the default address for Free Time 
    3: User adds an errand or errands containing 
        <title / type> 
        <Store_Name or exact_location or remote> 
            <remote> like call dentist to scedule cleaning
            <exact_location> like my persciroption is at THIS walgreens 
            <exact_location> we are meeting at This gps for picnic
            <store_name> like I need to get dog food from any Costco 
        <Priority>
            I need to feed and walk my dog every day
            but if I run out of groceries I can order delivery
        <Access_Type>
            Drive
            Bus
            Train
            All Transit
            Bike
            Walk 
        <expected time spend at that location> 
            In Minutes 
        <repeat interval> 
            never, daily, Every X days 
            weekly, weekly on X days,
            monthly, monthly but only on X days, 
                EX: I only want to get dog food from Costco during the week
            yearly, yearly but only on x days
        <Interval range in days or hours etc> 
            repeat interval +- Z days / hours 
            at least Y days inbetween 
            EX: I need to pick up my persciroption every 30 days exactly 
                I need to get dog food every month +- 3 days 
                I need to feed and walk my dog between 3PM and 5PM 
                    @home or @specific address
                I have to be at work for 9 hours, between 
    4: On update: Errand Planner will review calender and find best errand times / locations
    <Using Google Maps API>
        First, All time is labeled as free time 
        Stage 1: Plan Route to and from already planned locations / times using access type 
                Prioritize by length of planned time
                Prompt user to change acesss type or location if transit time overlaps any other planned errand
        Stage 2: Loop down priority levels and iterarte 
                For errands with particular locations 
                    A: Grab nearest locations within time range with enough free time 
                    B: Solidify most efficient time to errand                        

                For errands with only store names the planner will 
                    A: Grab locations nearest to every already planned location within allowed time range 
                        and without preventing missing any other interval
                    B: Grab locations nearest to already planned path 
                            paying particular attention to access type when it is transit
                            need locations near stops, locations near stops with fewest changes 
                    C: Solidify the least travel time location for this errand 

                If an errand cannot be planned, see if a surrounding errands can be moved 
                    flow up streams to shift multiple errands if needed and possible
                    If that cannot work, return all errands to original time and find best fit time then prompt user to decide to:
                        change time or range of sourounding errands 
                        change current errands range 
    <Additinoal functionality>
        1: Tell planner you've completed X errand 
        2: Tell planner tranist time was Z or errand time was Y for X errand
